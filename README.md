# Movie-Chatbot-Assistance
This chatbot will inform you about movies. Release year, cast, writer, director, IMDB ratings, awards and genre.  
The chatbot uses OMDb API to retrieve information about movies. 
he chatbot attempts to extract the movie title from the user's input, but if the input is not in the correct format, the chatbot may have trouble finding the correct title. So the word "movie" needs to be in input before the title of the movie.
I worked on google colab for this project.
